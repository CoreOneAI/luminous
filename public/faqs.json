    "answers": {
      "How often should I wash my hair?": "It depends on your hair type: oily hair 2-3 times per week, dry hair 1-2 times per week, normal hair every other day. Over-washing can strip natural oils.",
      "What's the difference between sulfate and sulfate-free shampoo?": "Sulfates are strong cleansers that can strip color and natural oils. Sulfate-free is gentler, better for colored or damaged hair, but may not lather as much.",
      "How do I protect my colored hair?": "Use color-safe shampoo, wash in cool water, limit heat styling, apply UV protection, and use a weekly color-protecting mask.",
      "Why is my hair frizzy after washing?": "Usually from towel-drying roughly, hot water, or lack of moisture. Try cool water, gentle patting with a microfiber towel, and leave-in conditioner.",
      "What's a hair mask and how often should I use it?": "Hair masks are intensive treatments that repair and nourish. Use weekly for normal hair, 2-3 times for damaged hair.",
      "Should I brush my hair when it's wet?": "Wet hair is more fragile. Use a wide-tooth comb starting from ends, or a wet brush designed for wet hair detangling.",
      "What's the best way to prevent split ends?": "Regular trims every 6-8 weeks, use heat protectant, avoid over-brushing, sleep on silk pillowcases, and deep condition regularly."

      "Can I color my hair if it's damaged?": "Depends on damage level. We'll assess your hair's condition first and may recommend treatments before coloring.",
      "How soon can I wash my hair after coloring?": "Wait 48-72 hours to allow the color to fully set. Use cool water and color-safe products when you do wash.",
